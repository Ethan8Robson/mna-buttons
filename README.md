# mna-buttons
A project dedicated to a club at my school. Takes the hardware for the current eyes and trivia programs and makes it better. Interfaces the previous buttons and adds wireless button functionality, making for a theoretical max of 32 buttons allowed for trivia at once.

## Goals (Listed in a rough order of when to do things, probably)
- [x] Making a breadboard prototype of the wireless buttons to ensure this actually works
- [ ] Hardware-based ID selection for wireless buttons on arduino program startup
- [ ] Interfacing wired and wireless buttons on the program
- [ ] Display for cool button status checking
- [ ] Adding controls on the button receiver hub to (hopefully) make using eyes and trivia easier
- [ ] Design case for buttons, decide which buttons/switches to use for button
- [ ] Prototype pcbs, of course with cool silkscreen art
